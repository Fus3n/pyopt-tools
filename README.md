# PyOpt-tools
PyOpt-tools contains a set of mirco function most of these functions are easy but **most of us** don't want to waste time searching for "how to reverse a string in python" or "how to sort a list by type in python" (which I didn't like to do too maybe some people do YOU NEVER KNOW) but as your here i am assuming you fall into "most of us" category.

You may find some function useful for you, but you may also find some of them useless. because there just way too small and you can write them anytime but its not about the functions complexity. its about knowing how to do it. most of us dont want to spend time finding functions like this just to prototype a project or just to test a function.


## What kind of functions?
Functions are separated into different files. there are currently **string_tools, math_tools, list_tools** and also **pyvec** pyvec contains vector 2 and 3 class that has some useful vector maths for game development. or you can use it to do normal stuff (not that game development isn't normal just saying)

Every function has proper documentation and comments with examples. But I also included all the functions in [example.py]("https://github.com/Fus3n/pyopt-tools/blob/main/example.py") file. Which will be updated as I add more functions.
